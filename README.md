The Coral EAMS Client is a lightweight GoLang-based agent designed to collect detailed system information such as CPU, memory, disk usage, OS details, hostname, network information (IP and MAC addresses), and other hardware/software metadata, and periodically send this data to a central EAMS server. It operates through a configuration-driven architecture using a config.json file that defines log file name, hostname, port, scheduler interval, sender API URL, and authentication token. The client includes a built-in cron scheduler that executes every X minutes (default 5) to collect system info and securely deliver it to the server using an HTTP POST request. Its modular structure includes logger, system collector, sender, and scheduler components inside the internal/ directory, with the main entry point in cmd/coral-eams-client/main.go. To run the client, developers simply load dependencies using go mod tidy, execute go run cmd/coral-eams-client/main.go, or build a production binary using go build -o eams-client. Logs are stored in the configured log file and include INFO, WARN, and ERROR levels for debugging and monitoring. The client is cross-platform and supports Linux, macOS, and Windows, with build commands for each environment. API payloads contain complete machine telemetry and are transmitted to the server endpoint defined in configuration. Troubleshooting involves validating config paths, ensuring valid SenderURL and AuthToken, and verifying scheduler intervals. This client serves as a secure, efficient, and extensible system information collector for integration with Coral EAMS infrastructure.
